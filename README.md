# Objective

This program helps a person figure out where is the best place to buy an item from, especially regularly-bought items.

The way it's supposed to be used is that someone keeps using the application every time they go to a store and add the items they usually buy. After a while,
they could list all the items, and not only see what they buy most often, but they could also see which store offers a better price for that item.

For example, let's say store X sells a loaf of bread for \$6, and store Y sells another one similar to that, or maybe even the exact same product, for just \$3. If we keep using this application, we could figure out those things and save money on our
monthly grocery shopping.

##### Menu:

1. Add an item
2. Delete an item (asks for id)
3. List all the items
4. List the items of a particular product i.e. Walnut

##### Items to specify when adding a new item:

- name (e.g. Banana)
- detailed name (e.g. Premium Banana Product of Ontario 2 lb)
- price (e.g. 1.99)
- before tax or not (e.g. Y)
- place (e.g. Walmart)
